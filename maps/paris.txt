This is based on the Catacombs in Paris.  This is a fictitious 
battle of course.  I intended to add a lot more stacks of bones 
to the level but it would have made things too cramped.  The map 
is infantry only because it's too small for engineers and hmgers.  

The lightning sounds are from one of Luisx's maps, edited to be 
a little quieter.
