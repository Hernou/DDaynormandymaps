First off thank you all whose textures I used in the creation of this map.

Over 1 - The Americans have to blow up twenty items, though there are 21 total. 

There is a tall rock wall in one of the corners. Behind it are several objectives. This wall takes a major hit to destroy so bring an engineer with tnt or a zooka. Once it blows it will take two of you to get over the remaining wall. There is a second wall back there whcih also needs two in order to get over.

The Germans have an open firing platform up in the trees to fire out of. It allows the Germans to rain down fire on the map, so the allies might want to assign someone to keep that spot supressed.

Basically just run around and shoot each other.
