  (MISSION BRIEFING)

  1.Allies

Your small squad of allied reinforcements has been deployed due east of a small German hamlet with limited supplies.
Battle your way past the corn fields and use teamwork to climb the fences and walls and infiltrate this once peaceful
town now turned into a German stronghold.  Allied flamethrower units are -NOT- available, so
use what forces you are left with.  Airborne class has been parachuted close to town walls, use this
to your advantage.  

Good Luck!

  (The Objectives)

Your task is to break through the German defences and destroy two of their high explosive crates, two of
their radio transmitters, a map of their strategic battle plans, a large bomb and their super computer.  We have ladders perched up against
their fortress walls, and wooden planks to gain entry to places that are difficult to reach otherwise.  But beware, they can
be destroyed and could cause major setbacks if such a thing occurs... but there MUST be other ways in.  Use teamwork, and use
their poorly constructed structures to your advantage.  

Victory can be gained by eliminating all of the German resistance, but it is not well advised, we're greatly outnumbered.

  (TNT) -- 50 pts. each
The TNT is rumored to be located within large wooden crates, but sources tell us that this town is lathered
with crates, but the enemy rushed to hide them. Check for open crates, or attempt to blast open crates
to find these high explosives.

  (Radio Transmitters) -- 50 pts. each
The enemy is believed to have two radio transmitters. To disable these electronic devices will be vital in 
assuring that the Germans can not call reinforcements in our attempts to liberate this small hamlet.  Search
the small town carefully in finding these small radio transmitters, eliminate on sight.  Sources tell us that one
is to believed to be on the rooftops of one of the buildings, poorly covered with a tarp.  Investigate this matter.

  (Enemy Battle Plans) -- 50 pts.
Conceiled in a warehouse on the other side of town.  Break through the warehouse, find these plans and destroy them.

  (Large Bomb) -- 100 pts.
We have reason to believe the enemy is hiding a very large bomb somewhere in this town.  We will try to radio you the
location of this bomb when we receive confirmation of its location, but they have an antennae blocking all of our
outgoing radio transmitions.  Find this tower and knock it out of commission so we can retain communication.

  (TOP SECRET :: Super Computer) -- 100 pts.
Little is known about this 'Super Computer', other than we are certain it must be disabled.  We are unsure of its
exact location, but we have visual of it (refer to respawn screen).  we have gathered that it's in a small enclosed
area, with a poorly sealed wall trying to hide its whereabouts.

  (UNKNOWN LOCATION :: Mysterious Crates) -- 1 pt.
There have been reports of mysterious crates sealed away, their contents are unknown, but whatever it is, it can't be
good.  This is not a primary objective, but finding these crates and destroying its contents might give us a clue
what this Nazi madman is thinking...

(note::I am well advised that no such thing probably existed during WWII, but it's just a game, and I needed
to make something that sounded important.  lol)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.Axis

Planes are flying overhead, dropping large groups of paratroopers into a clearing out in the wooded area on the outskirts
of our small base.  We must stand our ground and not let the Allied scum disrupt our operation.  

With such short notice, there was little we could do about the TNT, we couldn't move it all from the barn, so we had to leave
one opened crate behind, the other crate we sealed and moved to the other side of town.

Our transmitters are vital but we need open air to use them to their full potential.  We got one safely to the rooftops, and
covered it with a green tarp to protect it from aerial view and assaults, this is our main transmitter.  However, if it should be
destroyed, we have a backup transmitter in storage, but the lazy fools forgot to pack it away in crates.

We have sealed off the Super Computer to the best of our ability with such short notice of the incomming attack.  An electronically
controlled metal door, and even a brick-sealed wall cover it, it will be extremely difficult to penetrate this.  Snipers are possitioned
on the building containing both the device for opening the metal door, and also our battle plans.

Our secret weapon, the 'Large Bomb', or as we like to call it, 'Tod Von Oben'.  Is safely hidden away.  We are not worried about it being
discovered.

Look alive men, we have a heavily fortified base.  We have turrets possitioned around the stronghold.  Use them to your advantage,
but beware, the enemy can also use these.  They have put ladders up on our walls and wooden planks to use as walkways, use
them to your own advantage if you wish, or destroy them and they surely cannot win...  (or can they?)

SIEG HEIL!

  (The Objectives)

Kill 75 Allies and prevent them from destroying your objectives.

!!COMING SOON!!  (hopefully)

The updated re-release of my first (and unreleased... lol) DDAY map, "The Docks".  It was originally too big and the rspeeds were brutal,
I'm currently shrinking it down and fixing some things in the map, hopefully making it more playable for all players.  It will still
remain fairly large and wide-open, and will be pretty sniper-biased, though I hope people will enjoy it.
