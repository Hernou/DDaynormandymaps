This is an original texture art set originally created by Crista Forest
for use in Unreal based level creation and later converted to Quake2 format.

"These textures were designed for use in an Unreal level that was based
on the theme of a plantation mansion. I got the idea from a visit to
Jamaica and pictures of the Rose Hall plantation there.  However, my
textures and level were only inspired by the mansion. They are not meant
to be an accurate representation of it.

"There are approximately 60 original textures in this set which I
personally created. You may use these textures in your own Quake2
map for personal enjoyment only. You may NOT use these images for
commercial purposes without my written permission. When distributing
these textures please distribute them in their original .wal form as
a set and include this .txt file. Please do not distribute individual
textures or import them into other game texture sets. Thank you."
