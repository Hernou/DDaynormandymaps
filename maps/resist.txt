This is a map for the D-Day: Normandy Quake 2 modification. It also
requires the British Team DLL and the SHAEF server DLL to run.

Work started on this map in early 2002 to test the British Team DLL but
it was never released due to graphics related crashes. Since then the
map has been hugely modified and optimised to run without any known
issues.
