*Battle outline*

The Fuerlienne outpost is a once majestic french Chateau that has been turned into a small Axis outpost, one to play an important part in the war.
This axis outpost has been chosen as the site for the final testing of the newest axis Anti-Aircraft weaponry. 
Allied intelligence has discovered this and has put forward a small force to attack this mostly unknown outpost, and all 3 prototype A-A Guns must be destroyed!
The Axis outpost is now on full alert after detecting allied movements nearby, they must not be allowed to interupt this phase of the testing procedure!

Scoring:

For the allies to win they must destroy each of the 3 axis guns, gaining 20 points per target to reach the required total of 60 points.
They can also win by eliminating 50 Axis troops.
The Axis can only win by successfully defending at least one of the AA guns, and eliminating 50 allied troops.

Extra features:

A few of the objects around the map can be destroyed (with no points gain). This includes all sandbags, and the axis defensive pillboxes can be damaged significantly. The windows in the outpost are also breakable (and explosive).
These breakable objects are quite strong, and it would take prolonged fire or multiple grenades or rockets to show signs of the damage.

The short sewer section can also be entered by the allies destroying the hatch outside the axis outpost.

The Anti Aircraft guns are best destroyed with well placed grenades, (or sneaky officers! the axis side is advised to not allow allied in the base unnoticed!

**important**
The axis base was designed so that the allied troops could not access the rooms and corridors on the second level of the outpost (axis spawning area). However it is possible with some effort to access these areas, I can only suggest that in fairness, the allies don't make the required effort :)
