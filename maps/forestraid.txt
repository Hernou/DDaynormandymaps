Chat:
Ok, where will I start? This map was originally created in 1 peice but was unable to compile even with a maximum chop size set. Eventially I bit the bullet and split it in two, this also allowed me to increate the bounce and lower the chop as the massive map problems went away. 

This map has been designed with hardware acceleration in mind, and, in this frame of thought I compile with -nosubdiv which effectivly disables it in software mode(crashes). On the plus side the hardware r_speed is reduced by about 30% more in some places. I'll release a seperate version for software people but the r_speeds will be higher. You have been warned.

For the mappers look for the following features:
-Enemies that move in to tactical postions and hold there againts you attack while comrads attach you head on as a distraction.
-Watch out for the mines and tripwires.
-Enemies that run away and join their comrads behind a wall. 
-Key opened rotating door that stays openable once unlocked by key (they don't normally do that).

For the IT Professional look in the comms room for the Compaq Proliant 1600r's, the Cisco 2500 and the Cisco Local Director. They're real, imported from an image taken at work.
