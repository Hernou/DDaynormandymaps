=======================================================================

This is a map for Quake2 Dday (http://www.planetquake.com/dday).  You MUST have the Russian team dll pack installed to play this map. You also must have Dday version 4.1 and Windows if you want to host the map on a server (team dlls currently dont work on Linux servers).  If you try to run this map with Dday 4.0 it will not load.


Installation:
Just unzip all folders to your Quake2/dday folder.


Note:  If you have your gl_modulate set correctly and are running in GL mode, the ground of the map will blend perfectly into the ground drawn into the sky and it will look a lot nicer.  I run at the D-Day default of gl_modulate 1.5.  Make sure you have 8 bit textures turned off if you arent running in software mode or the sky will look ugly.

Credits:
The tank is a prefab by Col Piron.  Though the animations and one of the track textures are original.

The sky is an editted version of cm_scove256 by Chalupamonk.

Textures are original or taken from various sources off the net or dday textures.
