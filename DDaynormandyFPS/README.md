Hi,
At starting, this was a big pack maps for the open source game FPS "DDay: Normandy", now it's the full game data

If you can update it, do it !


[DDay source](https://github.com/PowaBanga/DDaynormandyFPS)


TODO
=========
 - Some maps are in double, with different names, because there is some developpement version. We have to dellete this.

 - Some texture are not chraged by yamagui linux (and maybe other Q2 clients) because the file in data don't respect the capital and lowercase. We have to fixe that.
